Terms shall be long enough to build trust and observe the way in which the trustee conducts their decision process in order to determine whether their decisions are in good faith. There shall be no 2 consecutive terms. There shall be no rotation between trustees, whether between 2 people, 3 people, or any number of people. Term elections shall be staggered, and the terms shall vary in length dependant on chair type as specified.

The bylaws should enumerate ways in which the character of the trustees shall be conducted, including not introducing issues in which the ulterior motive is to delay or convolute the board's processes. Each board meeting shall be filmed, where the body language, tone, and content of all speech and actions of each trustee should be able to be studied. All board meetings shall be recorded and the records available to the public forever.

Do what wikimedia does with chapters, having them separate organizations that work with methodocracy foundation. These would provide volunteer opportunities, mainly serving to allow normal user actions to be put on school volunteer requirements and to build resumes. It also serves as a position of honor and opportunity to advance to the board of trustees or help methodocracy foundation in some other way.

Have the board define what "community" means in the by-laws, but have a section that enumerates guidelines. Also ensure that the definition follows the mission statement.

Make sure that all interpretations of the missions statement, by-laws, and all actions of the board are made in good faith instead of stretching the boundaries based on a lack of specific wording. The goal of every action of a board member should be in good faith.
