  <p>We are setting up a scientific charity to run the development of a website and a knowledge base. These free products facilitate the act of problem-solving, for users to apply in any subject they wish. People who have something to say about a problem in the world, but are not in the professional debate about the issue, will be able to have a more effective voice. Together, we can be a force for effective change.</p>
  
  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  
  <p>To continually improve the best methods for problem-solving, starting by digitizing the scientific method into a knowledge base accessed and developed by users through a website. To apply this process to more subjects in which it is not being applied. To ensure that everyone can participate in the method and its debate free of charge, access the version history of the knowledge base, improve the method's design using the method itself, and contribute to the open-sourced development of the code. To facilitate citizen science, because the cooperative potential of uncredentialed thinkers is underused, and the subjects in which the scientific method is not being applied in could benefit from the scientific method.</p>  
  
  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  
  <div class="all-questions">
  
    <h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
	
	<h4>How does it work? What defines merit? How is methodocracy going to enforce the usage of the scientific method in its discussions? How reliable is the info? How do we start getting our ideas together?</h4>
	
	<p>Arguments in this knowledge base attempt to either disprove or support other arguments, and certain kinds of arguments hold more merit than others.</p>

	<h4>What problems are you trying to solve? What do you want to stop, or make better? What are some examples of problems that can be worked on using Methodocracy? How can online discussions help solve the world's problems? Why are you doing this? So what is it you hope to achieve? Who will this charity be helping?</h4>
    
    <h3 id="four">4</h3>
    
	<h4>What's wrong with the scientific method as it exists today? Which improvements are you making that make this a better way to solve problems than current ways?</h4>
	
	<h3 id="five">5</h3>
	
	<h4>Is there a best method for problem solving, especially a process that can be applied to all areas? Does "the best method for problem solving" apply to all of my problems?</h4>
	
	<h3 id="six">6</h3>
	
	<h4>Are opinions eradicated in this system?</h4>
	
	<h3 id="seven">7</h3>

	<h4>What if I decide the ideology I want is that "Girls have to hang out with their boobs out unles they're gross, also the goverment has to give up free pizza daily"? How will you deal with spam and trolls?</h4>
	
	<h3 id="eight">8</h3>
	
	<h4>How can you improve on a method design using the very method design?</h4>
	
    <h3 id="nine">What are the dangers?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances should Methodocracy.org and its content, in whole or in part, hold power over any individual<!--<link>legal</link>-->.</strong> It must be recognized that Methodocracy.org carries some Orwellian dangers, and proper precautions should be taken. The website is only a suggestive force to be executed by separate social entities or separate individuals. There should always be logical and ethical barriers between the content of Methodocracy.org and the behavior of society. If these precautions are taken, society will only benefit.</p>  
    
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances should Methodocracy.org and its content, in whole or in part, dictate the behavior of any individual<!--<link>legal</link>-->.</strong> Unethical arguments may hold higher merit than they should at certain points in time. This is because it takes time for other users to recognize the argument as unethical, then provide evidence supporting its unethicality. The same applies to situations in which entries are inaccurate. Because of these situations, it must be realized that Methodocracy.org does not always hold the best answer.</p>
