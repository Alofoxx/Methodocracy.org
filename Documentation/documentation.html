  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  
  <p>Methodocracy.org is a website that applies the scientific method and other methods to arguably every subject.</p>  
  
  <div class="all-questions">
  
    <h3 id="one">How does it work?</h3>
    
    <p>Users can browse, search, and submit entries to the website. Entries exist in a hierarchy, like a family tree, where each submission attempts to disprove or support its parent. Different types of entries hold higher merit than others. For example, a controlled experiment is more meritable than an observational study. A comment, which may contain opinions, is the least meritable.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="two">What is the aim of this site?</h3>
    
    <p>Methodocracy.org aims to provide an efficient and interactive platform for its users to convey information and feedback on any given topic. Users can utilize this platform to collaborate with others in discussion and research. The development of this platform does not cater towards any one particular purpose, but here are some predicted uses:</p>  
    
    <h3 id="three">Possible Purposes of Use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Evidence-based governance.</strong> Methodocracy.org could be used to determine the best ways to govern society. The process values evidence more than opinions. Through this process, the website can improve society relative to its current state. This purpose was actually the driving force behind Methodocracy.org's inception, but the project's goals have since been expanded.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Centralization of academic processes.</strong> Methodocracy.org attempts to provide an alternative medium for the advancement of academic fields. The website's goal is to increase its quality and efficiency to a level that makes this alternative more attractive than the status quo. With the notion that everything can fall under an academic field, Methodocracy.org attempts to be the central location for the advancement of knowledge.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Centralization of knowledge.</strong> Whether or not Methodocracy.org can house all knowledge is debatable. Regardless, the website attempts to store every piece of information so that it can be improved upon. Wikipedia<legal symbol and/or link> already accomplishes this task pretty well, but Methodocracy.org needs to store its own version of information so that it can be used within the site.</p></li>
        <li><p><em><strong>"Which recipe of apple pie is the best?"</strong></em> One answer could be correct for one individual, and another answer could be correct for a different individual. Methodocracy.org can be used to categorize all of the conclusions into a master conclusion that incorporates conditional logic. The website is not restricted to subjects deemed by most as important. All subjects, including the lighthearted ones, are included.</p></li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3 id="four">Who can use this project, and how?</h3>
    
    <p>Anybody can use Methodocracy.org, but there are systems in place that ensure only the most meritable arguments hold the most weight. There is also a system that ensures credentialed users have more merit applied to their submissions. These credentials are earned through a built-in education and testing system.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="five">What are the dangers?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances should Methodocracy.org and its content, in whole or in part, hold power over any individual<!--<link>legal</link>-->.</strong> It must be recognized that Methodocracy.org carries some Orwellian dangers, and proper precautions should be taken. The website is only a suggestive force to be executed by separate social entities or separate individuals. There should always be logical and ethical barriers between the content of Methodocracy.org and the behavior of society. If these precautions are taken, society will only benefit.</p>  
    
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances should Methodocracy.org and its content, in whole or in part, dictate the behavior of any individual<!--<link>legal</link>-->.</strong> Unethical arguments may hold higher merit than they should at certain points in time. This is because it takes time for other users to recognize the entry as unethical, then provide evidence supporting its unethicality. The same applies to situations in which entries are inaccurate. Because of these situations, it must be realized that Methodocracy.org does not always hold the best answer.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="six">Is this the best way to do things?</h3>
    
    <p>Questions such as this are within the scope of the site's collaborative problem-solving environment. All of the systems in Methodocracy.org are put under its own method. The applied practices of the site will always be scrutinized by users, who can provide input and potentially better practices, all through the site's methods. Methodocracy.org will improve over time.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="seven">Who can work on this project?</h3>
    
    <p>Most of Methodocracy.org's code and data is open sourced. Visit our <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHebert/Methodocracy.org" target="_blank">GitHub project</a> to view the project's files. If you would like to edit any part of the code, simply fork the project. You can use this edited version of the website for your own purposes (<a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHebert/Methodocracy.org/blob/master/License.txt" target="_blank">restrictions apply</a>), or you can request that your edits be pulled and merged into the main development branch. Some code and data is hidden for security purposes, or possibly if overwhelming evidence shows that hiding some code/data has a positive psychological effect.</p>
