  <h1 class="heading">Methodocracy.org</h1>
  
  <p>We are setting up a scientific nonprofit organization to run the development of a website and a knowledge base. These free products facilitate the act of problem-solving, for users to apply in any subject they wish. People who have something to say about a problem in the world, but who may not be in the professional debate about the issue, will be able to have a more effective voice. Together, we can be a force for effective change.</p>
  
  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  
  <p>To continually improve the best methods for problem-solving, starting by digitizing the scientific method into a knowledge base accessed and developed by users through a website. To apply this process to more subjects in which it is not being applied. To ensure that everyone can participate in the method, access the knowledge base and its history, and improve the method's design using the method itself, all free of charge. To keep the project open sourced. To facilitate citizen science, because the cooperative potential of all thinkers is underused, and the subjects in which the scientific method is not being applied in could benefit from the scientific method.</p>  
  
  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  
  <div class="all-questions">
  
    <h3 id="howitworks">How does it work?</h3>
	
	<img src="http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/abstract-network-12401131.jpg" alt="Knowledge base" width="530" height="390" />
	
	<h4>The Knowledge Base</h4>
	
	<p>Users browse, search, and submit arguments into the knowledge base. These arguments attempt to either disprove or support other arguments. Sometimes, it will be debated whether an argument disproves or supports another argument. At that point, the debate surrounding that connection has it's own subsection of arguments attempting to disprove and support each other. To use another example, peer review, which is necessary for increasing the merit of an argument, may be disproven itself, meaning that it wasn't a thorough review of the material and should be disregarded. If a user account submits many bad peer reviews, their peer reviews may hold much less weight, or their ability to issue peer reviews may be revoked, until they are educated on how to properly peer review. These are just a few examples, these principles can be applied to more tasks that are necessary for problem-solving.</p>
	
	<h4>The Merit Scale for Arguments</h4>
    
	<p>Certain kinds of arguments hold more merit than others. One problem with today's scientific method is that it almost entirely utilizes the most meritable methods of debate. Methodocracy attempts to utilize productivity from all arguments by ranking them in a merit scale. The most meritable methods for making an argument still hold the most weight, and less meritable arguments hold less weight. A less meritable argument could inspire a more meritable one, and if a lot of less meritable arguments are in a debate, a more meritable argument could be used to settle it. For example, a controlled experiment is the most meritable. Under that is observational studies. Somewhere in the middle is a research report compiled from multiple sources, under that is a logical thought process paper, under that is an idea, and at the very bottom is a comment and an opinion. When users search the knowledge base, the most meritable arguments will appear first. This ensures that at the end of the day, we value truth. The less meritable arguments are for approaching higher truths easier and quicker, because of the quantity of thinkers in this world.</p>
	
    <h3 id="scientificmethod">What is the scientific method?</h3> 
    
	<ul>
		<li>Observation</li>
		<p>Questions. Research.<p>
		<li>Hypothesis</li>
		<p>Educated guess. Predictions. Falsifiable, testable.</p>
		<li>Design Test</li>
		<p>This is where you create an experiment most of the time.</p>
		<li>Test and Collect Data</li>
		<p>Troubleshoot the procedure. Make observations.</p>
		<li>Analyze data</li>
		<p>Organize the data into tables. Create graphs and visualizations. Calculate shit. Analyse patterns.</p>
		<li>Form Conclusions and Publish</li>
		<p>Does the test results, data, and analysis support the hypothesis or falsify it? Does the hypothesis attempt to disprove or support a theory? Does is start to form a new theory? Explain hierarchy of theories.</p>
	</ul>
	
    <h3 id="whatswrongtoday">What's wrong with problem-solving today?</h3>
    
	<h4>Robust Information Storage</h4>
	
	<p>We as humans are really good at gathering to problem-solve. With the internet, it is becoming easier to come together. However, after the meeting has taken place, the records are rudimentary. Most of the time, the archives are simply strings of text stored in a database. All of the connections of how each argument disproved each other is not stored. Furthermore, the number of times an argument has been reproduced in history has not been recorded. One argument can have 100 replications, but the one that disproves it may have 1,000. If there were ever a paradigm shift because the 1,000 arguments were disproven, those 100 replications would be very beneficial.</p>
	
	<h4>Ideologies</h4>
	
	<p>Bringing together everyone into a central environment allows each of our ideas to possibly be disproved by others even if we don't expect it. While people upload their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs, other people can attempt to show the falseness or naivety of those arguments, and present better wisdom. This allows the human race to accumulate wisdom at a much faster rate, and it could prevent uninformed decisions. This is a very effective way to ground radical groups. Conversely, we may be able to glean some truth from these groups and their ways of thinking, and it's a method in which they can prove how their ideals may be better. Instead of segmenting the world into contrasting schools of thought, Methodocracy will bring everyone together to debate in search of the truth.</p>
	
	<h4>Increasing the Rate of Knowledge Acquisition</h4>
	
	<p>Today's scientific method almost entirely utilizes the most meritable methods of debate. Methodocracy attempts to utilize productivity from all arguments by ranking them in a merit scale. The most meritable methods for making an argument still hold the most weight, and less meritable arguments hold less weight. A less meritable argument could inspire a more meritable one, and if a lot of less meritable arguments are in a debate, a more meritable argument could be used to settle it.</p>
	
	<p>This allows content generation to be quicker, while still keeping the opportunity for thorough work open. Everybody will have a voice, because all of our ideas have at least some merit. When users search the knowledge base, the most meritable arguments will appear first. This ensures that at the end of the day, we value truth. The less meritable arguments are for approaching higher truths easier and quicker, because of the quantity of thinkers in this world.</p>
	
	<h4>Applying the Scientific Method to Everything</h4>
	
	<p>Probably the most important problem is that the scientific method is not being used in all of the subjects it could be used in. Only if we apply the best method for problem-solving to more areas, can we better increase the chances of survival and the quality of life for the most amount of individuals for the longest duration. We will use the method for:
	<ul>
		<li>Defining problems</li>
		<li>Determining if they're really problems</li>
		<li>Creating possible solutions</li>
		<li>Predicting the outcomes of those solutions</li>
		<li>Running everything through ethical concerns</li>
		<li>Synthesizing solutions together</li>
		<li>Figuring out which solutions are best for which situations</li>
		<li>Understanding how things currently are</li>
		<li>Laying out on the table the differences between the current systems and the ideal solutions</li>
		<li>Enumerating the required steps to transition from current systems to ideal solutions</li>
		<li>Criticising solutions that are accepted as good enough</li>
		<li>Making sure we don't tear down beneficial systems</li>
		<li>Analyzing the best postmortems</li>
		<li>Working on how to best teach all of this to people</li>
		<li>Anything else we can think of</li>
	</ul>
	We can use the method in politics, judicial systems, civil service, education, resource management, societal organization, and more. We can also use it to figure out how to get the upper hand in a video game, or to figure out which recipe of apple pie is the best for certain people.</p>
	
	<h4>Central Location and Target Audience</h4>
	
	<p>As it was briefly mentioned before, Methodocracy brings problem-solvers together into a central environment. People who use this product are ones whose goal is to make the world a better place, and who want to actually accomplish their goal more efficiently. Of course the real change comes with people executing what has been determined to be the best, but the people who use Methodocracy are the ones who think the plan through first. There are many forums and discussion boards on the internet, now there needs to be a main website with a focused mission.</p>
	
	<h3 id="bestmethod">Is there a best method for problem-solving?</h3>
	
	<p>Some methods govern other methods. If method A is best for solving problem C, and method B is best for solving problem D, then method M, the one that decides whether to choose method A or B based on whether the problem to be solved is problem C or D, is the best method to choose...always. This is because it incorporates, combines, and synthesizes all methods. Even though there are methods that govern other methods, all of them are important for executing and achieving the end results.</p>
	
	<h3 id="opinions">Are opinions disregarded in this system?</h3>
	
	<p>Even though opinions are the least meritable argument, they are still important. Opinions are what fuel the effort to put forth more meritable arguments. Methodocracy's aim is to increase the rate at which ideas are debated, so limiting that in any way would not be beneficial. However, other types of arguments still hold more weight than opinions, so that over time opinions do fall by the wayside. Opinions are most often the start of a journey towards the truth, which is very important.</p>
	
	<h3 id="professionals">Can professionals participate as well?</h3>
	
	<p>Yes. Even though Methodocracy makes it easier for non-professionals to have a say in the debate, professionals can be users as well. There will be a system in place that verifies if an account is being used by a professional. If it is, then every argument the account makes in the individual's qualified fields will have a flag denoting their status, and the argument may hold higher merit by a small margin. Methodocracy is for everyone and will not limit our problem-solving potential in any way.</p>
	
	<h3 id="selfimprovement">How do you improve the method using the method itself?</h3>
	
	<p>Questions such as this are within the scope of the site's collaborative problem-solving environment. All of the systems in Methodocracy.org are put under its own method. The applied practices of the site will always be scrutinized by users, who can provide input and potentially better practices, all through the normal debate process hosted by the site. The development staff will look over the input and debate issues of how the community is saying the site should be improved, and decide which of those to impliment at the given time. The development staff will more often than not use the community's findings as a starting point, and build upon it for the actual implementation. Many design decisions will not be made without consulting the community first. Methodocracy.org will improve over time.</p>
	
	<p>For example, one design decision that needs to be made is exactly how to rank each type of argument on the merit scale. Once the company is running, the design team will tackle problems such as these, and consult the community when it would be beneficial to do so. Once any system on Methodocracy is up and running, the community will naturally be able to give feedback from what they observe.</p>
	
	<h3 id="spam">How will you deal with spam, hate, and the like?</h3>
	
	<p>There will be a reporting feature and a terms of use agreement. The terms of use will enumerate standard policies to ward off spam, hate, and unnecessarily obscene content. If a user encounters content that violates the terms of use, they can report the argument to the moderators. The moderators will then review the case and take appropriate action, possibly deleting or temporarily hiding the content.</p>
	
    <h3 id="dangers">What are the dangers?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances should Methodocracy and its content, in whole or in part, hold power over any individual<!--<link>legal</link>-->.</strong> It must be recognized that Methodocracy carries some Orwellian dangers, and proper precautions should be taken. The website is only a suggestive force to be executed by separate social entities or separate individuals. There should always be logical and ethical barriers between the content of Methodocracy and the behavior of society. If these precautions are taken, society will only benefit.</p>  
    
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances should Methodocracy and its content, in whole or in part, explicitly dictate the behavior of any individual<!--<link>legal</link>-->.</strong> Unethical arguments may hold higher merit than they should at certain points in time. This is because it takes time for other users to recognize the argument as unethical, then provide evidence supporting its unethicality. The same applies to situations in which arguments are <em>inaccurate</em>. Because of these situations, it must be realized that Methodocracy does not always hold the best answer.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="whoweare">Who is making Methodocracy?</h3>
	
	<p>We are setting up a scientific nonprofit organization to run the development of Methodocracy. Efforts are under way to incorporate with the state of California and get the official IRS tax-exempt status of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. All proper documentation is being drafted, and the nonprofit organization will follow regulations and be held accountable like any legitimate nonprofit organization. Funding will come from donations by people like you, grants, and other sources that are common for a non-profit organization. Operations will start small and grow when we are provided with enough support.</p>
	
    <h3 id="howtohelp">How can I help?</h3>
    
	<h4>Volunteer</h4>
	
	The most straight-forward way in which you can help is to be a user when the product is ready. All our users are volunteers, but there are more involved volunteer positions available. If you are interested in volunteering to set up the company right now, which is critically important at the present, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@methodocracy.org">contact@methodocracy.org</a>. Our most involved, important, and honored volunteer position is a board member. If you are willing to go above and beyond to change the world, let us know if you are interested in becoming a board member. Other ways in which individuals or organizations could volunteer or provide free service are providing employee training, consultations, office equipment, computers and networking hardware, open sourced code contributions, documentation writing (very important at this moment), donations (always important), or other partnership agreements. Be sure to contact us to arrange the particulars if you are interested. Please note that we do not have our 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization status yet, and donations are not tax deductible at this time.</p>
	
	<h4>Spread the word</h4>
	
	<p>Be sure to like our <a href="" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page and tell your friends about us. Even better, tell your business contacts about us and get them to contact us in order to set up board member positions, partnership relationships, and most importantly, future major investment interest, and current minor (or major) investment opportunities.</p>
	
	<h4>Open Sourced Development</h4>
	
    <p>Most of Methodocracy.org's code and documentation is open sourced. Visit our <a href="https://github.com/Methodocracy/Methodocracy.org" target="_blank">GitHub project</a> to view the project's files. If you would like to edit any part of the code or documentation, simply fork the project. You can use this edited version of the website for your own purposes (<a href="https://github.com/Methodocracy/Methodocracy.org/blob/master/License.txt" target="_blank">restrictions apply</a>), or you can request that your edits be pulled and merged into the main development branch. Some code and data is hidden for security purposes.</p>

	<h4>Business Card Fundraiser</h4>
	
	<p>We are running a little business card fundraiser at the moment. We are collecting donations in order to fund the purchasing of business cards and other miscellaneous supplies. In addition to gathering resources, this fundraiser also serves to give us practice fundraising and networking, and increase morale. We are looking for small donations, but if you would like to make a bigger donation then you are more than welcome to do so. Please note that we do not have our 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization status yet, and donations are not tax deductible at this time.</p>
