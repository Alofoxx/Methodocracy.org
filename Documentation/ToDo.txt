##To-do list

* In-depth research of scientific method.

* Design functionality of indexing, search, predictive search? (user analytics like facebook and google? relevancy to current location in website, etc), related education, exploration, in-house news distribution (and real-world news interfacing for that matter), etc. Should indexing use reddit-type url's and permalinks, with possible improvements and expansions to the system?

* Research GitHub Pages

* Research how bitcoin works and get security ideas from it. Again, security may not be too necessary, it is to be determined.

* Create non-profit company to run main branch of the open-sourced code. Can non-profits run crowdfunding without limitation?
