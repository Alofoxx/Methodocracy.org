To increase chances of survival to prevent the extinction of our species and quality of life, Because I want a method in which to improve the world around me, increase quality of life, give everyone what they need, Because I'm a vulnerable child that needs to be taken care of and who wants to care for everyone in the same way, Because there are pains and suffering we go through that society doesn't pay attention to. There is more to our existence than we have been taking care of, and we know of these aspects, and we can take care of it through organization, for the most amount of individuals for the longest duration,  make a place where all thinkers and problem-solvers go. Because it is possible to improve society, I believe that we CAN solve problems.
