Honor.

Do not cause any problems. Promoting civil debates. Celebrating differences in opinion and belief. Equal access and participation. Sharing ideas freely. I believe that everyone should have a voice. Improve democracy. To not tolerate blatant unethicality or inaccuracy within Methodocracy for any long period of time. Ensure integrity and accuracy, especially of history. Prevent Methodocracy holding any power beyond suggestive. Maintain logical and ethical barriers between Methodocracy and its content and society. Checks and balances. Openness. Transparency.


Morals and ethics.

Wisdom when making decisions. Honesty. Responsibility. Selflessness. Giving. Kindness and love. Peaceful. Caring for everyone. Encouragement. I believe in pure good, that everyone tries to be good. To improve the world around us. Increasing chances of survival and quality of life for the most amount of individuals for the longest duration.


Commitment to improvement.

Quality. Organization. Efficiency. Effectiveness. Cooperation. Data, Information, and Knowledge. Quantifying everything. Expressing everything in mathematical and logical models. Metrics.


Inspiration.

Questioning everything. Think big. Make new systems that makes the old ones obsolete. Never blame an individual, only blame systems. Think as one race instead of many individuals. Creativity. Make our product, volunteer opportunities, employment, investments, and partnerships fun and engaging.
