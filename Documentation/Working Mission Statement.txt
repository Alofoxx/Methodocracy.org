To develop the best method for problem solving. To apply this process in all areas. To ensure that everyone can participate in the process, access its archives, and improve the method. To digitize the scientific method, making it a computer program accessed through the internet, and use it to help solve the world's problems.

By developing a problem solving framework that can be applied to all fields of study, we hope to digitize the scientific process. This framework will be available to anyone via online tools so they can participate in the process, access its archives, and help solve the world's problems by participating in this collaborative community.
