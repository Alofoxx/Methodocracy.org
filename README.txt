Methodocracy.org

We are setting up a scientific and educational nonprofit organization to run the development of a website and a knowledge base. These free products facilitate the act of problem-solving, for users to apply in any topic they wish. People who have something to say about a problem in the world, but who may not be involved in the professional debate about the issue, will have a more effective voice. Together, we can be a force for effective change.

Mission Statement:

To continually improve the best methods for problem-solving, starting by digitizing the scientific method into a knowledge base accessed and developed by users through a website. To apply this process to topics that currently are not scrutinized using the scientific method. To ensure that everyone can participate in the process, access the knowledge base and its untampered history, and improve the design of the process, all free of charge. To keep the project open sourced. To facilitate citizen science, because the cooperative potential of all thinkers is underused, and all topics could benefit from being scrutinized using the scientific method.
