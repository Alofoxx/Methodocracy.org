Methodocracy.org

We are setting up a scientific charity to run the development of a website and a knowledge base. These free products facilitate the act of problem-solving, for users to apply in any subject they wish. People who have something to say about a problem in the world, but are not in the professional debate about the issue, will be able to have a more effective voice. Together, we can be a force for effective change.

Mission Statement:

To continually improve the best methods for problem-solving, starting by digitizing the scientific method into a knowledge base accessed and developed by users through a website. To apply this process to more subjects in which it is not being applied. To ensure that everyone can participate in the method and its debate free of charge, access the version history of the knowledge base, improve the method's design using the method itself, and contribute to the open-sourced development of the code. To facilitate citizen science, because the cooperative potential of uncredentialed thinkers is underused, and the subjects in which the scientific method is not being applied in could benefit from the scientific method.
